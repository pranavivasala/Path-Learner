## Features

This application has evolved from a simple generator into a feature-rich learning platform:

  **🤖 AI-Powered Path Generation:** Integrates the **Google Gemini API** to generate high-quality, day-by-day learning plans for any topic.
  
  **🔐 Secure User Authentication:**
      * Full user registration and login system.
      * Passwords securely hashed using **bcrypt**.
      * Password strength validation (length, numbers, special characters).
      * A multi-step "Forgot Password" flow using a secret question.
  
    ** 🗃️ Database Integration:** Uses **SQLite** to persistently store all user data, saved learning paths, task progress, and user feedback.
    
    **📊 Interactive Progress Tracking:**
      * Users can mark individual tasks as complete using interactive checkboxes.
      * Progress is saved instantly and visualized with dynamic **Plotly** gauge charts for each learning plan.
      
   **🗓️ Extensible Long-Term Plans:** Intelligently generates long-term plans (e.g., 90+ days) in manageable 7-day chunks, which users can extend on demand.
   
   **👍 User Feedback System:** Allows users to rate each generated path as helpful or not helpful.
   
   **👑 Admin Dashboard:** A password-protected admin view to see all user feedback in one place.

## Technology Stack
